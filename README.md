# Tweet2Geo

This project aims to understand the international interest and attention between countries by using geolocated Twitter data from three regions of the world: Europe, South America, and the United States.
It builds the networks of international interest and it adopts gravity models to explain the patterns and drivers of the mentioning behavior between countries. Finally, it extracts the topics from the text of the tweets to contextualize the obtained results.
